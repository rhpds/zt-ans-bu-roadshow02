*Lab Guide - Scenario 02: Standardized Consistency*


## Introduction

Ready to dive into real automation? You've been tasked with configuring a new environment for multiple teams using standardized, consistent deployments. This scenario demonstrates how Ansible Automation Platform enables different technology teams to collaborate effectively by using pre-built playbooks and templates.

By leveraging workflow templates, job templates, and secure credential management, you'll deploy and configure everything consistently across your infrastructure, minimizing manual intervention and ensuring accuracy.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lab, you will be able to:

* **Create and execute workflow templates** that orchestrate multiple job templates
* **Implement secure credential management** using Ansible Vault
* **Deploy standardized configurations** across Windows and Linux environments
* **Manage infrastructure as code** through automated inventory management

## Exercise 1: Baseline Configuration and Applications

### Understanding the Request

[role="border"]
image::ticket01.png[Support Ticket 001]

You've received a support ticket requesting configuration updates for two Windows servers in the UAT (User Acceptance Testing) environment. The requirements include:

* **Deploy a standard set of applications**
* **Apply specific registry changes** for environment compliance
* **Disable automatic updates** to ensure stability
* **Prevent unintended changes** during testing phases

To address this request efficiently, you'll create a workflow template that combines multiple job templates into a logical, repeatable process.

### **Step 1: Create a Workflow Template**

1. **Navigate to Automation Execution → Templates**
2. **Click Create template**
3. **Select Create workflow job template**

**Workflow Configuration:**

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
|Field |Value

|Name
|Windows Apps and Settings

|Organization
|Default

|Description
|Required Applications and Settings

|Inventory
|Windows Servers
|===

4. **Click Create workflow template**

This will open the **Workflow Visualizer** where you'll design your automation workflow.

### **Step 2: Add the First Workflow Step**

1. **In the Workflow Visualizer, click Add Step**

|Field |Value

|Node Type
|Job Template

|Job Template
|Windows Registry keys

|Convergence
|Any
|===

2. **Click Next and Finish**

### **Step 3: Add the Second Workflow Step**

1. **Select the +...+ menu** on your first step
2. **Click Add step and link**

**Second Step Configuration:**

[cols="1,2", options="header"]
|===
|Field |Value

|Node Type
|Job Template

|Job Template
|Windows Server Applications

|Status
|Always run

|Convergence
|Any
|===

3. **Click Next and Finish**
4. **Select Save** to save the workflow

### **Step 4: Execute the Workflow**

1. **Navigate to Automation Execution → Templates**
2. **Select the Windows Apps and Settings workflow**
3. **Click Launch template**

**Monitor the workflow execution** in the output. You'll observe how the workflow orchestrates multiple job templates:

* **First:** Windows Registry keys configuration (completes with green checkmark)
* **Then:** Windows Server Applications installation (blue spinning arrows while running)

[NOTE]
====
The complete workflow takes approximately 3-4 minutes. Both Windows servers will be configured with necessary registry changes and applications required by development teams.
====

### **Step 5: Verify Application Deployment**

1. **Click on the Windows Server Applications icon** in the Visualizer
2. **Review the job output** to verify deployed applications
3. **Notice packages like procexp, windirstat, and other development tools** have been installed

## Exercise 2: Domain Controller Configuration

### Understanding the New Request

[role="border"]
image::ticket02.png[Support Ticket 002]

A new infrastructure request has arrived from the operations team:

* **Configure one Windows server** as a domain controller

* **Prepare another server** for database services

* **Ensure compliance** with organizational policies

Your Windows SMEs have provided job templates to deploy this environment consistently.

### **Step 1: Verify Current Server State**

1. **Navigate to the Windows tab**
2. **Click the Start/Windows button** and open **Server Manager**
3. **Select Local Server**
4. **Verify the server is currently part** of the default **WORKGROUP** with limited services

image::workgroup.png[Current Server Configuration]

### **Step 2: Configure Secure Credentials**

1. **Navigate to your AAP tab**
2. **Go to Automation Execution → Templates**
3. **Edit the Windows Domain Controller template**

Your Windows team has provided an Ansible Vault for secure credential storage. This ensures Active Directory credentials remain encrypted and protected.

**Adding Vault Credentials:**

1. **Click Edit template**
2. **In the Credentials section, add the Windows Vault credential**
3. **Save the job template**

[role="border"]
image::vault.png[Vault Credential Configuration]

[IMPORTANT]
====
Ansible Vault credentials ensure sensitive information remains encrypted and secure. You don't have direct access to the credentials, maintaining security best practices.
====

### **Step 3: Deploy Active Directory**

1. **Launch the job template** using **Launch template**
2. **Monitor the output** as each task executes

[role="border"]
image::dnsdomain.png[Domain Configuration Process]

**The template will display the domain/forest information** generated by the environment. Record this domain detail for future reference.

[NOTE]
====
This process takes several minutes to deploy Active Directory and reboot the system. After reboot, default Group Policies will also be applied.
====

### **Step 4: Verify Domain Controller Configuration**

After the system reboots:

1. **Click Start/Windows** and open **Server Manager**
2. **Verify the domain now reflects** your DNS domain from the template output
3. **Confirm that DNS and Active Directory services** are running

## Exercise 3: RHEL Server Deployment

### Expanding Infrastructure

With Active Directory configured and Windows servers deployed, the next step involves deploying a RHEL system for streaming applications. Your standardized build templates will streamline this process.

[NOTE]
====
This exercise simulates provisioning tasks. In production environments, you would customize instance configurations to meet specific requirements.
====

### **Step 1: Review Current Inventory**

1. **Navigate to Automation Execution → Infrastructure → Inventories**
2. **Examine existing inventories:**
   * Network environments
   * Windows environments
   * Video Platform Inventory (currently contains only a loadbalancer group)

[role="border"]
image::invbefore.png[Current Inventory State]

**You need to deploy a RHEL system** and configure a webservers group for future use.

### **Step 2: Deploy New Node**

1. **Navigate to Automation Execution → Templates**
2. **Launch the Deploy Node template**
3. **When prompted for the node name, enter:** `node01`
4. **Submit the job**

[TIP]
====
In this simulated environment, we use configuration as code to build inventory. With inventory plugins, you could synchronize against an inventory source.
====

### **Step 3: Verify Inventory Updates**

1. **Once the job completes**, navigate to **Automation Execution → Infrastructure → Inventories**
2. **Observe the new webservers group** with your new node in the **Video Platform Inventory**
